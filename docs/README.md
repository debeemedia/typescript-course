## 🧩 Why I Wrote This

I wanted a single, readable resource that explains why TypeScript behaves the way it does — not just what the syntax is.
Every example in this guide was tested in real TypeScript projects using frameworks like AdonisJS within Node.js environment, to stay practical and current.
