To effectively learn TypeScript, foundational knowledge of JavaScript is required. As stated in the introduction, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, therefore, a solid grasp of fundamental JavaScript concepts will aid in understanding TypeScript's additions and how they relate to the underlying JavaScript. You don't want to have to learn two things at once (language + type system).

You should already know:

- how JavaScript runs (e.g. in Node or the browser)
- variables (let, const) and data types (string, number, boolean etc.)
- functions (including arrow functions)
- objects and arrays
- classes and inheritance basics
- how `this` works
- modules (import/export)
